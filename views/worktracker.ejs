<!--
This HTML file is a view template for displaying work tracker data.
It contains a table that shows the details of work tracks, such as name, user ID, event ID, booking ID, and work done.

The template uses EJS (Embedded JavaScript) syntax to dynamically render the data received from the server.

The structure of the file is as follows:
- The <head> section contains meta tags and the page title.
- The <body> section contains a container div and a table.
- The table has a header row with column names and a body section that iterates over the worktracks array to display each work track as a row.

CSS styles are defined within the <style> tag to format the table and the container.

Variables used in the template:
- title: The title of the page.
- worktracks: An array of work track objects, each containing the following properties:
    - name: The name of the work track.
    - user_id: The user ID associated with the work track.
    - event_id: The event ID associated with the work track.
    - booking_id: The booking ID associated with the work track.
    - workDone: The work done for the track.

Note: This file is intended to be used as a view template with a server-side framework that supports EJS.
